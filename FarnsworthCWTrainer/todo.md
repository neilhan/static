High-level pass shows the trainer is in better shape overall, but a few structural upgrades would still pay off:

[x] Snapshot-driven UI (Todo 6). App.tsx still derives highlighting and message text manually. Since the sender already tracks snapshot state, you can remove the custom character counters entirely and have the UI render directly from snapshot (and maybe expose a helper that returns {done, remaining} strings). That would eliminate the last bits of duplicate state.
[x] Settings/data flow. With pagesByType, the Controls component is now writing nested objects (updateSetting('pagesByType', …)). Consider giving Controls a dedicated updatePages(type, value) callback to avoid passing whole objects down. Also, settings updates currently trigger full re-renders; a lightweight context (instead of prop-drilling settings/updateSetting) would make the tree cleaner.
[x] Sender API ergonomics. useMorseSender now exports a lot of knobs (loadMessages, play, pause, etc.). Wrapping the sender in a thin context/provider would make it easier to use across components (e.g., if you want separate display and transport widgets later). It also makes testing easier because you can mock the context.
[x] Token metadata reuse. createMorseSender emits SenderCharMeta for spaces, characters, etc. You could move the string-cleaning logic (removing @, skipping spaces) into the sender itself and expose a getDisplaySlices() helper. That would let you remove the renderMessage() substring math from App.tsx and keep all Morse-specific logic in one place.
[x] Componentization of controls. The controls file is nearing 300 lines. Breaking it into smaller chunks (speed settings, content toggles, action buttons, page picker) would improve readability and let you reuse the page picker elsewhere if needed.
[x] Styling/layout. The main layout is still tied to a max-width 800px container. If you plan to add waveform visualizations or more telemetry, consider extracting the layout shell so Farnsworth matches the other projects’ header system automatically.
[] Testing hooks. Given how critical the sender is, adding unit tests for createMorseSender (e.g., verifying pause/resume, skip, contact page counting) would help guard against regressions, especially since Node upgrades may force a build/test pipeline soon.
